# Testing Guide

## Testing Commands:

Tests are made against Lacchain Open Pro Testnet; even so you can adapt the code to test the identity contracts flavor which are compatible with any EVM network other than Lacchain Networks.

```sh
 yarn hardhat test test/identity/Identity.test.ts  --network lacchain
```
