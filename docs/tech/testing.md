# Testing Guide

## Testing Commands:

To run tests against hardhat just run the following command:

```sh
yarn hardhat test
```

Tests are also made against Lacchain Open Pro Testnet; even so you can adapt the code to test the identity contracts flavor which are compatible with any EVM network other than Lacchain Networks.

```sh
 yarn hardhat test  --network lacchain
```
